# Client-Feedback-Tool
We all wonder why it is so important to ask for a feedback to our clients or the persons who have used our service. Well, its obvious to understand, for improving the standards of service delivered. But we all fail to understand the other important features that is playing behind the scene.  When you are receiving a feedback, you are not only getting a response but you are listening to their indirect needs and communicating it through corrections implemented. Feedback is considered as showing the appreciation towards a work and also measuring how much understanding we have made out for our clients.  Based on all these factors, we can update ourselves how much we stand apart from rest of competitors or how much we fall short. This helps to update us to the market trends and needs, facilitating better service to our clients.  Finally, there is no success without a happy client who are satisfied with the service delivered. A satisfied client is also considered as a sustained client, who will keep approaching us again for their future needs.
